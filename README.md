## Overview
**NWKIT** ([/njuÀêkit/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=nju%CB%90kit&voice=Joanna)) is a toolkit for manipulating phylogenetic trees in the [Newick format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format). 

## Installation
```
# Installation with pip
pip install git+https://github.com/kfuku52/nwkit

# This should show complete options
nwkit -h 
```
